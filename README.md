This is an application that uses react and JavaScript to implement a simple calculator that can do
basic arithmetic and trigonometry. You can enter math problems either with your keyboard or by clicking on the buttons.
One other thing that you can do is customize the name of the calculator by clicking on the name and then entering a new one.
